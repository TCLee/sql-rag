    "# Build a Question Answering system over SQL data\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling a LLM system to query structured data is very different from unstructured text data. For **unstructured** text data, we use text embeddings that can be searched against a vector database. For **structured** data (e.g., relational database), we need the LLM to write and execute queries in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A system over tabular data in databases. We will cover implementations using both **chains** and an **agent**. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a database and get back a natural language answer. The main difference between chains and an agent is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many times as it needs to answer the question.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your agent's needs. This will reduce though **not** eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system.
