    "# Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling a LLM system to query structured data (e.g., database) is very different from unstructured text data. For **unstructured** text data, we generate text that can be searched against a vector database. For **structured** data, we need the LLM to write and execute queries in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A system over tabular data in databases. We will cover implementations using both **chains** and an **agent**. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a database and get back a natural language answer. The main difference between chains and an agent is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many times as it needs to answer the question.\n",

    "> Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this.
